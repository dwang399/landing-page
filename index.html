                    Parker's Meat People have been finding solutions to every day problems for over 70 years! Find out what we can do
                    for you! When Honza Hajek immigrated from Czechoslovakia in 1921, he had one goal in mind. He wanted to bring
                    the delicious way of meat cooking from his native country to the beautiful state of Colorado. Since then, his
                    great-grandson Parker now serves customers all over the world. Whether you are a returning meatman, or a first
                    time vistor, we have what you're looking for!
