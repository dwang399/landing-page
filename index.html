                    Parker's Meat People have been finding solutions to every day problems for over 70 years! Find out what we can do
                    for you! When Honza Hajek immigrated from Czechoslovakia in 1921, he had one goal in mind. He wanted to bring
                    the delicious way of meat cooking from his native country to the beautiful state of Colorado. Since then, his
                    great-grandson Parker now serves customers all over the world. Whether you are a returning meatman, or a first
                    time vistor, we have what you're looking for!

            <div class="quote">I was at a dark point in my life. I needed meat bad and I had no where else to turn to. 
            I opened the phone book and called the first number I saw. Lucky for me, that number was Parker's Meat People.
            They gave me meat when no one else would. Consider me a life long customer.
